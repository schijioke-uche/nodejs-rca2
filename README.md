## Running The Example

You can run this example as node processes on your localhost, as pods on a local
[OpenShift Local](https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-local/overview) installation.

### Localhost

To run the basic application on your local machine, just run the commands below:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

This will launch the application on port 8080.

Other options:

* `npm run dev` same as `npm start` but with pretty output log.
* `npm run dev:debug` shows debug information.

### OpenShift Local

OpenShift Local should be started, and you should be logged in with a currently
active project. Then run the `npm run openshift` command.

```sh
$ crc setup # Set-up the hypervisor
$ crc start # Initialize the openshift cluster
$ oc login -u developer # Login
$ oc new-project my-example-project # Create a project to deploy to
$ npm run openshift # Deploys the example app
```
